#### why poisson rather than Gaussian?
 combined with Poisson instead of Gaussian
statistics makes it possible to reliably analyze low signal data.

####
solving the discrete Laplace transform using Poisson statistics and 
applying an even more robust regularization approach (k-fold cross-validation),
(In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned 
into k equal sized subsamples.)
