#### Why Poisson Rather than Gaussian?
combined with Poisson instead of Gaussian
statistics makes it possible to reliably analyze low signal data.

#### Algorithm 
solving the discrete Laplace transform using Poisson statistics and 
applying an even more robust regularization approach (k-fold cross-validation),
(In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned 
into k equal sized subsamples.)

#### Data Sets
In order to show the effectiveness of the method, we apply our decay rate analysis 
to two computer-generated data sets: 

- a biexponential decay (Figure 3) and 
- a stretched exponential

#### ToDos 
Simulate the followings: 
- bi-exponential decays
