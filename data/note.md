## biexponential decay
- sum of two delta functions centered at 0.01 and 0.2 ns−1
- add a background noise, corrupting the signal with Poisson noise so that 
  the peak number of counts is 1000× higher than the mean counts of the noise.

## terminology

#####t_ww : characteristic relxation time (uniquely determined by the material's property)
